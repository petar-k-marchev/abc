measure-arrange strategy
	a visual remembers the last measure arguments and whenever smth that 
	may affect	its desired size changes then a re-measure pass is scheduled
	and the same measure arguments are used. if the desired size has not changed
	then measure-invalidation is not raised. this should be optional because
	a container may have measured it several times with different args in order
	to fit it somewhere, the container may have some complex strategy.

ui-pass, touch events, dispatcher
	start
	should dispatched things get executed here?
	touch events are raised
	dispatched things (from touch events, like scheduled measures) are executed here
	root is arranged (propagation down to its visuals - measure and arrange pass)
	end


measure and arrange pass
	invalidate measure ?
	ok .... so what happens when during measure something says - invalidate measure
	is that legal?
	same question for during arrange
	invalidate layout ? wtf is this

visual tree
	how do you make the visual tree so that
	wpf can have a vis tree per control (because wpf control is a visual, hence its own visual tree)
	skia can share visual tree accross controls (put a gauge and chart inside 
	an abc grid, the abc grid can be the visual tree for both controls, hence save performance/memory)
